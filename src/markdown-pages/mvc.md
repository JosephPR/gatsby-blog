### Understanding the MVC structure.

While pondering my approach to the next three weeks of coding bootcamp, I decided to do some research on MVC and try to understand why it is such a powerful design pattern in programming.

> MVC is an application design model comprised of three interconnected parts.
> Model talks to the database and the controller.
> View is what the user sees and interacts with, it is mostly comprised of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

> Controller is the glue. It takes in a user request then interacts with both the views and the model. Here is where everything is organized and updated. The controller tells views what to display to a user, and gets the data needed from the model to make that happen.

>Let’s say you walk into an ice cream shop and order a vanilla milkshake. You are the User, the guy behind the counter (we are going to call him Phil) is the Controller, the recipe and instructions to make a milkshake is data, obtained from the model. The model also holds all the tools to make a milkshake, (Phil couldn’t make a milkshake if he didn’t have milk! It would also be a lot harder without a mixer as well.) Thankfully Phil had the tools and made the tastiest vanilla milkshake ever!! The finished product is the view, its what you see and taste.

MVC is a great way to structure web applications, it is widely used throughout many frameworks and languages.
