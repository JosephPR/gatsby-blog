So you want to make your app more interesting but don’t know where to start? These packages will give you an idea of how to add pizazz to your application.

1.Faker.js

Faker is a great way to save your self some time creating data for testing your application. You can create people, companies, accounts, products, images, text and more. http://marak.github.io/faker.js/ this link is a great way to get started creating dummy data for any app. You can use faker in the browser or on the backend with Node.js, here an example of how to use it in the browser:
```<script src = "faker.js" type = "text/javascript"></script>
<script>
  var randomName = faker.name.findName(); // Caitlyn Kerluke
  var randomEmail = faker.internet.email(); // Rusty@arne.info
  var randomCard = faker.helpers.createCard(); // random contact card containing many properties
</script>
```

2. Lodash.js

Lodash is the most popular library on github with over 20 million downloads a week, it is the sibling of underscore.js. Lodash is a javascript library that helps simplify common programming tasks of managing and editing objects and arrays. Lodash is one of the handiest tool for working with collections in JavaScript.
```
var array = [1];
var other = _.concat(array, 2, [3], [[4]]);
console.log(other);
// => [1, 2, 3, [4]]
console.log(array);
// => [1]
```

3. Request.js

Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default. It has fifteen million downloads a week. When using node.js you will be making a lot of http requests, make it easier on yourself and use Request.js, here’s a basic setup:

```
var requirejs = require('requirejs');

requirejs.config({
    //Pass the top-level main.js/index.js require
    //function to requirejs so that node modules
    //are loaded relative to the top-level JS file.
    nodeRequire: require
});

requirejs(['foo', 'bar'],
function   (foo,   bar) {
    //foo and bar are loaded according to requirejs
    //config, but if not found, then node's require
    //is used to load the module.
});
```

4. Chalk.js

You can style terminal output in Node.js for the sake of adding emphasis super simple, super lightweight and fun. Almost twenty six million downloads per week, Here's an example to checkout in your console:
```
var chalk = require('chalk');
console.log( chalk.bgRed('red') );
console.log( chalk.bgBlue('blue') );
console.log( chalk.bgGreen('green') );
console.log( chalk.bgMagenta('magenta') );
```

5. Express.js

By far the best way to simplify setting up your backend with node. The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, or public HTTP APIs. You can be up and running in no time with this simple setup:

```
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
res.send('Hello World')
})
app.listen(3000)

```

Experiment with all these, I’m sure you’ll find value in all of them.
